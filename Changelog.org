* Since 0.2
  - API CHANGE: The `Reader` and `Writer` types were inadvertently
    marked `Sync` when they are not. While you may read and write from
    separate threads safely, it is neither safe to read from two
    threads or more threads nor write from two or more threads.

* Since 0.1
  - API CHANGE: `RingBuffer::new()` no longer takes an argument.
  - `Copy` trait is no longer required on most `RingBuffer` methods.
  - Added two methods for bulk copying data in/out of the ring buffer:
    `Reader::shift_into()` and `Writer::unshift_from()`.
  - Added 'Iterator` implementation to `Reader`.
  - Minor performance optimizations.
